I am Cross Disciplinary Fellow ([XDF](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cross-disciplinary-fellowships)) 
at the MRC [Human Genetics Unit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit) and
[School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics)  at the University of Edinburgh, 
with a background and training in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.
 
I develop and apply machine learning methods to extract informative
patterns from high-dimensional multi-omics datasets (bulk and single-cell),
with the overarching goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the
gene-regulatory mechanisms driving cellular-state transitions.
The current biological focus of my work lies in the field of very early eye development,
where I collaborate closely with wet-lab scientists to unpick the crucial
molecular events required to establish the earliest ocular structures in mammals.
This work has the potential to inform genetic diagnoses of pediatric eye-malformations,
in particular through the identification of non-coding causal variations.



For my Undergraduate and Masters (Part III) degree I read Mathematics at the 
University of Cambridge after which I moved to Durham University to undertake my 
PhD research in Theoretical Particle Physics (high-precision perturbative QCD).
Following my PhD, I was fortunate enough to spend time working with world-leading
researchers as a visiting student at CERN, and as a Post-doctoral researcher at 
DESY, Hamburg and at the Cavendish Lab, University of Cambridge.
