I have recently taken up the position of Senior Computational Biologist at 
the [CRUK Beatson Institute](https://www.beatson.gla.ac.uk/) working within the 
group of [Crispin Miller](https://www.beatson.gla.ac.uk/beatson-research/beatson-research-groups/crispin-miller-computational-biology.html).
Prior to joining the Beatson, I was a Cross Disciplinary Fellow ([XDF](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cross-disciplinary-fellowships))
working at the MRC [Human Genetics Unit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit) and
[School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the University of Edinburgh, 
within the groups of [David FitzPatrick](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/fitzpatrick-group)
and [Catalina Vallejos](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/). 
 

I develop and apply machine learning methods to extract informative
patterns from high-dimensional multi-omics datasets (bulk and single-cell),
with the overarching goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the
gene-regulatory mechanisms driving cellular-state transitions.
During my time as an XDF, the biological focus of my work lay in the 
field of very early eye development, where I collaborated closely with 
wet-lab scientists to unpick the crucial molecular events required to 
establish the earliest ocular structures in mammals.
I am now excited to apply the expertise and knowledge gained during 
my years in Edinburgh to tackle fundamental questions in cancer!
<!---
This work has the potential to inform genetic diagnoses of paediatric eye-malformations,
in particular through the identification of non-coding causal variations.

For my Undergraduate and Masters (Part III) degrees I read Mathematics at the 
University of Cambridge, after which I moved to Durham University to undertake my 
PhD research in Theoretical Particle Physics (perturbative QCD).
Following my PhD, I was fortunate enough to spend time working with world-leading
researchers as a visiting student at CERN, and as a Post-Doctoral researcher at 
[DESY](https://www.desy.de/index_eng.html), Hamburg and at the [Cavendish Lab](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge.

Details of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=34R7AfUAAAAJ) and
